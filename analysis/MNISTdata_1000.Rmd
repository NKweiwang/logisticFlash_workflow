## MNIST data 

> The MNIST database (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 20x20 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels

## TSNE on the MNIST data

[TSNE paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf)

## TSNE on the small sample size of the MNIST data (original data)

How about we only have 1.6% of the data?

Here, we pick 1000 digits out of 60,000, each digit only have 100 samples.

The TSNE result looks like

## TSNE on the binaried data in the small samples

We think the in this data, the nonzero values means that the picture of the digit contain this position, So we use the binaried data and run TSNE on that.

the different between the original data and binarized data looks like:

## TSNE on the Logistic Flash result (exclude the first factor) on the binaried data

We use logistic flash (K = 9) on the binarized data. In the factors, the first one is the common factor and we exclude that one, and then apply TSNE on the logistic flash result.

## TSNE on the svd result (exclude the first factor) in the original data

We think that the plots looks better might due to substracting the common factor. We apply SVD (K = 9) on the original data and exclude the first factor. Applying TSNE on the SVD reslut.
